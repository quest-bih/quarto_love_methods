# quarto_love_methods

A workshop tutorial for writing scientific manuscripts using Quarto in RStudio

Starting from the \`index.qmd\` notebook as a template the tutorial demonstrates how to populate a Quarto notebook with:

-   citations

-   hyperlinks

-   inline code expressions

-   tables

-   cross-references

-   figures

-   embeded figures from a different notebook

In the documet you will find some placeholder content that you can replace or blank spaces that look like this one \[\_\_\_here\_\_\_\], that you can populate with content of your own.

It is recommended that you use RStudio to work through the `index.qmd` notebook. To work on your own copy of the project, you can clone it from this repository.
